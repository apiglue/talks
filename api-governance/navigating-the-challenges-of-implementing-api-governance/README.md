## Abstract

As organizations increasingly rely on APIs to power digital transformation, the need for consistent, scalable, and secure API management has become critical. However, implementing effective API governance is a complex endeavor fraught with challenges that span technical, organizational, and cultural dimensions. This talk delves into the multifaceted challenges of API governance, including:

1. Balancing standardization with flexibility to accommodate diverse use cases.
