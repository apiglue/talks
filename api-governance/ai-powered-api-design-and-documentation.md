# AI-Powered API Design and Documentation

## Abstract

Traditional API linting tools like Spectral have helped teams identify issues in their OpenAPI specifications by surfacing violations of style guides and best practices. But the current paradigm stops at diagnosis—developers are still left with the manual burden of interpreting warnings, resolving inconsistencies, and applying often repetitive best practice fixes.

This talk explores a transformative approach: using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on industry API standards to go beyond pointing out what’s wrong—to actively fixing it. Imagine replacing “Here’s a list of errors” with “Here’s your new spec, clean, compliant, and ready to ship.” By shifting from rule-checking to rule-enforcing via intelligent automation, teams can significantly reduce friction in their design workflows, improve standardization, and cut review cycles.
