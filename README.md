## API Design

### [Accelerating the API Design Lifecycle with Mocking](api-design/accelerating-api-design-lifecycle-with-mocking/README.md)

In today’s fast-paced development environment, delivering robust and efficient APIs requires a streamlined design process that minimizes delays and maximizes collaboration. Mocking has emerged as a transformative tool in the API design lifecycle, enabling teams to prototype, test, and iterate at unprecedented speeds.

This talk explores the role of mocking in enhancing API design workflows, focusing on its ability to:

- Facilitate early stakeholder feedback by simulating API behavior before development.
- Enable parallel development by decoupling frontend and backend teams.
- Identify design flaws and inconsistencies earlier, reducing costly downstream changes.
- Support rapid iteration and experimentation without impacting live systems.

Using real-world examples and best practices, we’ll demonstrate how tools like Prism and WireMock can be leveraged to create mock APIs that enhance collaboration, improve quality, and dramatically accelerate development timelines. Attendees will leave with actionable insights on integrating mocking into their API design lifecycle, fostering innovation and speed without compromising reliability.

### Improving API Design with the help of LLM

Traditional API linting tools like Spectral, have helped teams identify issues in their OpenAPI specifications by surfacing violations of style guides and best practices. But the current paradigm stops at diagnosis—developers are still left with the manual burden of interpreting warnings, resolving inconsistencies, and applying often repetitive best practice fixes.

This talk explores a transformative approach: using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on industry API standards to go beyond pointing out what’s wrong—to actively fixing it. Imagine replacing “Here’s a list of errors” with “Here’s your new spec, clean, compliant, and ready to ship.” By shifting from rule-checking to rule-enforcing via intelligent automation, teams can significantly reduce friction in their design workflows, improve standardization, and cut review cycles.

## API Governance

### Navigating the Challenges of Implementing API Governance

As organizations increasingly rely on APIs to power digital transformation, the need for consistent, scalable, and secure API management has become critical. However, implementing effective API governance is a complex endeavor fraught with challenges that span technical, organizational, and cultural dimensions. This talk delves into the multifaceted challenges of API governance, including:

- Balancing standardization with flexibility to accommodate diverse use cases.
- Aligning cross-functional teams with varying priorities and levels of API maturity.
- Ensuring compliance with evolving security, privacy, and regulatory standards.
- Overcoming resistance to change and fostering a culture of accountability.
- Integrating governance processes without stifling innovation or agility.

Drawing on over 10 years of experience dedicated exclusively to API strategy, governance, and implementation across industries, the presenter will share actionable insights and proven strategies for addressing these challenges. Attendees will gain practical tools to define clear governance frameworks, leverage automation, and promote stakeholder alignment, ensuring scalability, reliability, and long-term success in a rapidly evolving API ecosystem.
